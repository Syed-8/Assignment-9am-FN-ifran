// 1. A React conponent that displays tree reprensents the hierachical structure of companies in an applcation
// is shows how a parents components passess data due to child components using props.
// Example sstructure 0f companies
// App (root commponents )Header,Main,,Sidebar,Content,Card,Footer

//2 . * look for repeat UI elements (buttons,cards,lists).
// *separate sections like header ,footer,navigation,main content.
// *identify parts that manage thier own data or logic .
// * Group related elements into a single component.

//3. A Static HTML page converted into React components by breaking it application easier to maintain and scale
// Identify page sections (Header, Navbar, Content, Footer).
// Create a separate component for each section.
// Replace static data with props.
// Manage dynamic behavior using state and events.

//4. Page Reload -No full page reload-Full page reload
// Performance -Faster after first load -Slower due to reloads
// User Experience -Smooth and interactive -Less interactive
// Routing -Client-side routing -Server-side routing
// Technology -React, Angular, Vue - HTML, CSS, server templates

//5. The React ecosystem includes tools and libraries that support development:
// Create React App / Vite – Project setup
// React Router – Navigation and routing
// Redux / Context API – State management
// Axios / Fetch API – API communication
// Babel – JavaScript compiler
// Webpack – Module bundler
// ESLint – Code quality checking
// Jest / React Testing Library – Testing

// 6.React is a JavaScript library used to build fast, interactive, and reusable  user interfaces, mainly for single - 
// page applications.It allows developers to create UI using component and efficiently update the view when data changes.

//7. Component-Based Architecture – UI is divided into reusable components, making code easy to manage.
// Fast Performance – Uses Virtual DOM to minimize direct updates to the real DOM.
// One-Way Data Binding – Makes data flow predictable and easier to debug

//8.A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads only one HTML page and dynamically updates the content without reloading the entire page.
// SPAs provide a smooth user experience and are commonly built using frameworks like React.

//10.The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM maintained by React.
// When changes occur, React first updates the Virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version, and then updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, improving performance.
